# React-App-Deployed-on-AWS-with-Custom-Domain-
🎯 React App Deployed on AWS with Custom Domain!
I deployed a React web app using AWS Amplify, connected my custom domain via Route 53, and enabled HTTPS out of the box. This project gave me hands-on experience with:
🔧 AWS Amplify for CI/CD & hosting
🌐 Route 53 for DNS management
✅ Domain verification and A/CNAME record setup
🔐 Automatic SSL via Amplify
